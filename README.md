# Turkey-Italy-salary-vs-inflation
My current girlfriend is Turkish and she has some debatable opinions about Turkish and Italian (EU) inflation that are clearly not reflected in the data. 

I had to show show her she's wrong. 

What's better than sending a github link to her, a PhD student in Law?
